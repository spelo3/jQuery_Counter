#Closure counter

In this exercise I experimented with jQuery closures. The page consists of a counter that responds to increment, decrement, and reset buttons.

I also added a button that lets you add and remove counters. Each counter you add will append a row to the table having a counter display and four buttons on each row -- increment, decrement, reset and delete.

This jQuery exercise helped explain functional programming using closures in a simple, hands on approach.
